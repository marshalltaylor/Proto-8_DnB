#### /Proto-8/Projects
The project folder contains builds of individual synths and concepts that run on hardware not standard to the Teensy.

These are designed to run on Teensys with expanded IO (Proto-8).

**Contents:**

* Classic2OSC -- A simple emulation of the pro-one.  This require the proto-8 libs and the big panel.
* **Broken**: Update for uCModules 2.0**PatchCordChanger -- (successful) Experiment in swapping patch cords live.
* **Broken**: Update for uCModules 2.0**PCCBlock -- An experiment with creating a audio system block for manipulating patchcords.
* Proto-8_Template -- The hardware layer with panel components matching to the locations of the "big panel".  This has been migrated to use with the proto-8 libs
* README.md -- This file
