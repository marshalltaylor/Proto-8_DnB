# Proto-8 Hardware Test

Operate the hardware at the most basic level.  This was designed to be run with the Arduino serial monitor.  Bring the input field into focus then us the enter key to walk through the test.

## Basic Features

* Walks through LEDs
* Reads all knobs
* Walks through mux select pins
* Applys patterns to matrix columns
* Reads buttons
* Plays unique tones from both headphone ports

## Post test

After the script is complete, the program outputs compact data to the monitor and maps a few knobs to LEDs so that you can 'move' them around.
